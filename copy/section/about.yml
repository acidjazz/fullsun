title: about us 
copys:
  - We are the smallest grains of rich, healthy soil. We are the oxygen thick air provided by the forests of Humboldt County. We are the caring hands that turn high quality, chemical-free cannabis into beautifully crafted concentrates, allowing your life to be a little easier.
  - Lastly, we are the rays of sunshine that spill down upon the mountaintop â€” the bright and most powerful source that enriches all of our cannabis at Full Sun.
